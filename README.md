# [Introduction and showcase of Julia for Geoscience](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU25/session/53623) - EGU 2025

Julia offers a fresh approach to scientific computing, high-performance computing and data crunching. Recently designed from the ground up Julia avoids many of the weak points of older, widely used programming languages in science such as Python, Matlab, and R. Julia is an interactive scripting language, yet it executes with similar speed as C(++) and Fortran. Its qualities make it an appealing tool for the geo-scientist.

Julia has been gaining traction in the geosciences over the last years in applications ranging from high performance simulations, data processing, geostatistics, machine learning, differentiable programming to general modelling. The Julia package ecosystem necessary for geosciences has substantially matured, which makes it readily usable for research.

This course provides a show case of some cool geo-applications and a hands-on introduction to get you started with Julia. We aim to give a broad overview of Julia and its ecosystem as well as going through hands-on coding exercises based around concrete earth science applications. In particular you will:
- Learn about the Julia basics and why it is such an interesting language for science
- Showcase of
  - Visualisation of Geo-Data using the plotting library Makie.jl and various geodata libraries
  - Global ocean modelling with Oceananigans.jl on CPUs and GPUs
  - Interactive atmospheric modelling with SpeedyWeather.jl
  - Ice flow modelling and data integration and sensitivity analysis using automatic differentiation on GPUs with FastIce.jl
- Learn the basics of Julia to get you started
